# grep 1 (general, 75pts)

> Can you find the flag in this [file](./assets/file)? This would be really obnoxious to look through by hand, see if
you can find a faster way.

Use [`grep`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/grep) to search for the flag:

```sh
$ grep "picoCTF" file
picoCTF{grep_and_you_will_find_c709fa94}
```
