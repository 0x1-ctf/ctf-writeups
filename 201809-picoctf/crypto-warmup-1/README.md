# Crypto Warmup 1 (crypto, 75pts)

> Crypto can often be done by hand, here's a message you got from a friend, llkjmlmpadkkc with the key of thisisalilkey.
Can you use this [table](./assets/table.txt) to solve it?.

The table looks like the one used in a [Vigen√®re Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher).

Enter the ciphertext `llkjmlmpadkkc` and key `thisisalilkey` into a [solver](https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher) to
get the plain text message:

```
secretmessage
```

Using the `picoCTF{...}` format, the flag becomes:

```
picoCTF{secretmessage}
```
